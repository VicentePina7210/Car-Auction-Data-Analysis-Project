  ### About the project:
The objective of this project is to analyze a used car dataset to discover possible trends, and insights that can reveal useful information that can help with decsion making. The results of this analysis will help with insights such as which factors or characteristics about the used vehicles, influence the selling price of the car.

The insights that are discovered through the analysis of this dataset will hopefully be something that can be useful to various people. This data can provide information for potential buyers on what to look out for when looking to buy a used vehicles. Likewise, it could also help sellers and dealerships find out what is a fair selling price given the characteristics of their vehicle to sell vehicles quickly.

  ### Questions:
1. What causes car prices to spike, particularly when a vehicle is older?
2. Which car makes or models provide the best value in terms of price being steady over time?
3. In which states are vehicles sold the most, and could the location of a vehicle contribute to it's value?
