    "# Car Price Prediction and Condition Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to analyze car price data and predict car conditions using various machine learning models. It explores regression and classification techniques to evaluate the performance of different algorithms, refine models, and provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and conditions. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.\n"
